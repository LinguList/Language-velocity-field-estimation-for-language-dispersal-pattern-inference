# Language-velocity-field-estimation-for-language-dispersal-pattern-inference
R package and tutorial for the language velocity field estimation (LVF).
Due to the memory limitation, the file "Supplementary_Materials：R_codes_for_validations_and_comparisons_of_LVF" is zipped into two .rar files: "R_codes_for_validations_and_comparisons_of_LVF.part1" and "R_codes_for_validations_and_comparisons_of_LVF.part2". 
These two .rar files need to be unzipped together to extract the complete files of Supplementary_Materials：R_codes_for_validations_and_comparisons_of_LVF.
